Hey! My name is James and I like to code cool, nerdy things. Currently working on a calorie-measuring software for use when cooking and exercising.

My interests include:
- Coding
- 35mm Photography
- Videogames
- Music (Rock n' roll, bachata, traditional Greek motherland stuff)
- Fitness
- Red wine

Looking forward to working on projects in this great online community :blush:
